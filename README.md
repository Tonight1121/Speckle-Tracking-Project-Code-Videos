# Speckle-Tracking-Project-Code-Videos
The code and video files for Samuel Sklar and Olivia Sergent's final BME 8730 project on speckle tracking. Discussion of these files is included in our final report.

Output videos are labeled as VideoName_method_checksize

Outputs for SAD and BSP are not appreciably different so only SAD and CCR videos are shown

Note: code for the cross correlation broke somehow after I made the videos and I can not get it working again.
